## Proof of concept

This repository contains a proof of concept for a vehicle search application powered by AI/Vector Search. The application consists of two main components:

1. Web Scraper: A custom-built web scraper that pulls data from the Bristol Street Motors website. This scraper collects vehicle information such as make, model, year, price, and features.

2. AWS Amplify App: The frontend application built using AWS Amplify (with React) and DataStax's AstraDB for the VectorDB. The VectorDB is used to perform advanced search and vehicle recommendation based on user preferences.

Please note that this is a proof of concept and may not have full production-ready features. Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs.
